Models:
- Basic sklearn models (Logistic regresssion, ...)
- LFM, BPR
- Text models, BERT

TODO:
- Script that collects all figures from analysis
- Make models/basic_tuning/
    - Separate files for each (logistic_regression.py)
    - Master script that calls them, writes their results (params/accuracy) to csv file
- Create popularity feature (count item ids?

Keywords (include as many as we can in our report, makes it sound good)
- Jaccard, cosine similarity/matrix, MSE, BER, latent factors, early stopping (on validation set), one hot encoding (try multiple encoders?),
